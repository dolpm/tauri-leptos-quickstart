# tauri-leptos-quickstart
Just a simple template to get tauri communicating with a leptos front-end.

No, this combo isn't a be-all-end-all performance wise... It uses some JS glue; performance hasn't been tested but don't get your hopes up ;)

# Running the app
### dev: ```cargo tauri dev```
### prod: ```cargo tauri build```
